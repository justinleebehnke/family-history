    "notes": "Note that the family member names are spelled differently, Ernst -> Ernest, Dorothea -> Dorothy, Erna -> Ella, but I still believe these records refer to the same family based on the location of the family and the ages and names of the children. I am going to assume that either more American names were chosen deliberately or that the enumerator did not hear/record correctly. It's interesting to note that additional details have been recorded on the record, their home was reported as being owned as mortgage free. Ernst and Dorothea were able to read and write and could speak English but their mother tongue was German. It says they were both born in the same place in Germany, it looks like it may be \"Hanover\" which is where many of the neighbors are from. Ernst was a farmer."
